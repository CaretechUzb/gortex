// ResolverHelper adapts one or more *Provider instances for resolve-
// time use by the cross-file resolver. The resolver consults this
// helper as part of the hot path for every TS/JS/JSX/TSX edge (see
// internal/resolver/lsp_resolve.go). Compared to the enricher path
// (Provider.Enrich), the helper holds the language server warm
// across the whole resolve pass and applies a per-call timeout so a
// stalled server never gates the resolve.
//
// Two ownership contracts live behind this one type, and they differ
// in exactly one respect — who owns the *Provider:
//
//   - Router-backed (NewLazyResolverHelper). The helper owns NO
//     provider. Every Definition call re-runs the lookup closure
//     (Router.ForSpecWorkspace) to acquire the provider for that one
//     call. On a router cache hit that lookup is a map read which also
//     refreshes the router's lastUsed, so a provider under active
//     resolve traffic is never reaped mid-pass; when the router has
//     already reaped or LRU-evicted it, the lookup spawns a fresh,
//     router-TRACKED replacement. Caching the pointer across calls
//     (what this helper used to do) let the router drop the provider
//     from its map while the helper kept the only reference: the next
//     EnsureClient saw a dead client and re-spawned the LSP subprocess
//     behind the router's back, leaking a process tree that nothing
//     could ever reap for the life of the daemon.
//   - Helper-owned (NewPooledResolverHelper with poolSize > 1, and
//     NewResolverHelper with a concrete provider). The helper spawns
//     and owns its providers and borrows one per call from a pool
//     channel. These providers sit outside the router's bookkeeping by
//     construction, so an in-place respawn inside EnsureClient is the
//     helper's own business; Close shuts them down.
//
// Concurrency model: one Definition call uses exactly one provider at
// a time. Router-backed mode holds h.mu across the whole call — the
// router hands every caller the same *Provider and a provider's stdio
// is single-threaded, and pool size is 1 in that mode anyway, so this
// matches the throughput of the borrow channel it replaced.
// Owned-pool mode borrows from a channel of N independent providers
// (= N tsserver processes for the TS spec), giving mutual exclusion
// per provider and parallelism across them.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   - Constructed once per (workspace, language family) at index time.
//   - Owned-pool mode lazy-spawns N underlying LSP subprocesses on the
//     first Definition call. Router-backed mode spawns nothing of its
//     own — the router does, on demand, inside its own reap/evict
//     accounting.
//   - Caches no answers across passes — the resolver owns dedup via
//     its lspIndex.
//
// Memory note: each pooled provider opens files independently via
// EnsureFileOpen. For workspaces with thousands of hot source files
// the per-provider state can add up; the pool size knob trades
// throughput for tsserver memory.
