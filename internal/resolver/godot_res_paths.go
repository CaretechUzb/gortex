// Two extractors mint these placeholders and neither could resolve them:
// the scene extractor's `[ext_resource path="res://…"]` (a scene → script
// / sub-scene / asset edge) and GDScript's `preload("res://…")`. Without
// this pass a Godot script's blast radius misses every scene that mounts
// it, because in Godot a script is reached through its scene rather than
// through a call.
//
// The project root is recovered by path suffix rather than by locating
// project.godot: a `res://` path is already rooted, so the indexed file
// it names is the one whose repo-relative path ends with it. Ambiguity
// (the same relative path under two project roots in one workspace)
// refuses rather than guesses — see uniqueFileSuffixMatch.
//
// Runs serially in ResolveAll's relative-import settle window, alongside
// the Lua require binding it mirrors.
