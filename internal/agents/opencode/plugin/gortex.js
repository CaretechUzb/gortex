// Gortex plugin for OpenCode (1.18.18).
//
// OpenCode has no lifecycle-hook configuration at all — there is no
// settings key that runs a command on session start or before a tool
// call. A JS/TS plugin is its only enforcement surface, so this file is
// the OpenCode half of the Gortex bridge: on each relevant plugin hook it
// shells `gortex hook --agent=opencode`, writes a BridgeEvent envelope to
// stdin, and applies the BridgeDecision it reads back.
//
// Every policy decision — the deny / enrich / consult-unlock / nudge
// postures, indexed-source classification, telemetry — stays in Go
// (internal/hooks/opencode.go + pi.go). Re-implementing any of it here
// would give OpenCode a second, drifting copy of rules every other host
// reads from one place.
//
// This file is written verbatim by the `opencode` adapter except for
// three sentinels, each replaced with a JSON literal at install time:
//
//   GORTEX_BIN        -> string:  resolved `gortex` binary path
//   GORTEX_HOOK_ARGV  -> array:   full hook argv, argv[0] included
//   GORTEX_ENFORCE    -> boolean: false when installed with --no-hooks
//
// Zero package dependencies, deliberately: OpenCode installs plugin
// dependencies from `.opencode/package.json` with a bun install at
// startup. Anything beyond a `node:` built-in would need a package.json
// this installer does not own, and a failed install would take the plugin
// down with it.

// The adapter does not write this file at all under --no-hooks, so a
// rendered `false` only ever reaches disk via a hand-copied or downgraded
// install. Honouring it anyway costs one branch and means the documented
// off switch still works on a file that outlived its installer.

// How long a single bridge call may take before we give up and let the
// tool through. The Go side answers from a local daemon in single-digit
// milliseconds; this ceiling exists for the pathological case (daemon
// mid-restart, machine swapping), where waiting longer would be felt as
// the agent hanging.
//
// Templated rather than literal so a test that asserts what a decision
// DOES can buy itself a budget the machine can actually meet. Every
// install renders the 5000 ms default; see defaultHookTimeoutMS.
