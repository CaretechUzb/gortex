// purgeUnprefixedRepoRows is the v6→v7 in-place step that retires
// single-repo (unprefixed) mode's on-disk residue.
//
// WHY A MIGRATION IS REQUIRED. Before v7 a workspace's only repo was indexed
// WITHOUT a prefix: its nodes carried an empty repo_prefix and raw
// repo-relative ids ("internal/foo.go::Bar"). The indexer now always
// prefixes, so on the first warmup after upgrading the same repo is
// re-indexed under "<repo>/internal/foo.go::Bar". Nothing removes the old
// rows — they belong to no tracked prefix, so PurgeRepo never sees them and
// OrphanRepoPrefixes deliberately exempts the empty prefix. The store would
// carry both copies: roughly double the nodes, doubled search hits, per-repo
// counts disagreeing with whole-store counts, and index_health reporting
// green over all of it. That is a silent wrong answer, which is why it is a
// schema boundary and not a best-effort cleanup.
//
// WHY IN-PLACE RATHER THAN rebuild:true. A rebuild is three lines and always
// correct, but planSchemaMigrationWith reads the flag statically — there is
// no "rebuild only if this store has unprefixed rows" strategy — so every
// multi-repo workspace would eat a full cold index (hours on a large one)
// for a change that cannot affect it. A solo workspace must cold-index
// either way, since its ids all change; this targets the cost at the stores
// that actually need to pay it.
//
// WHAT IS DELETED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY KEPT. The predicate selects rows
// with an empty repo_prefix AND a non-empty file_path. The file_path guard is
// the whole safety argument: synthetic GLOBAL EXTERNALS (dep::…, external::…,
// non-Go module::…, legacy bare builtin::…) also carry an empty repo_prefix
// and must survive — they model third-party symbols owned by no repository
// and are visible from every repo by construction. They have no source file,
// so requiring one selects exactly the file-backed code nodes that used to be
// a solo repo, and never the shared stub namespace.
