// Package pathguard confines filesystem paths to a repository root.
//
// A symbolic link inside an indexed repository can point anywhere on the
// host filesystem. Any code that admits a file into the indexed corpus —
// or that later re-reads one of those files to serve its content — must
// refuse a link whose real target escapes the repository. Otherwise the
// repository boundary stops being a security boundary: a link committed
// as `pwn.go -> /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` is indexed like ordinary source
// and its content is served verbatim by any tool that reads the corpus.
//
// The two halves of that rule are deliberately separate:
//
//   - Admission (the indexer walk) keeps escaping links out of the corpus
//     in the first place, so every downstream reader inherits the fix.
//   - Read time (each content sink) re-checks, so a corpus built by some
//     other path — an older on-disk index, a caller that assembles its own
//     file list — still cannot serve out-of-repo bytes.
//
// Confinement is always relative to the ONE root that owns the file, never
// to the union of every tracked root: repo A must not read repo B's files
// through a link, even when both are indexed by the same daemon.
